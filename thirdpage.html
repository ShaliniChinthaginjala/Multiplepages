            <p><i><b>Kerala</b>  is a state on the Malabar Coast of India.It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and Travancore.Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the 21st largest Indian state by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea[18] to the west. With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.The Chera dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE). The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, there were two major princely states in Kerala: Travancore and Cochin. They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi in 1949. The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India, which later became a part of the Madras State post-independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara, and the erstwhile state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district, and Shenkottai taluks).[17]Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in India, 3.44%; the highest Human Development Index (HDI), 0.784 in 2018 (0.712 in 2015); the highest literacy rate, 96.2% in the 2018 literacy survey conducted by the National Statistical Office, India;the highest life expectancy, 77.3 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men. Kerala is the second-least impoverished state in India according to the Annual Report of Reserve Bank of India published in 2013.Kerala is the second-most urbanised major state in the country with 47.7% urban population according to the 2011 Census of India.The state topped in the country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals according to the annual report of NITI Aayog published in 2019.The state has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly Malayalam and sometimes English. Hinduism is practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam and Christianity.The economy of Kerala is the 8th-largest in India with ₹8.55 trillion (US$110 billion) in gross state domestic product (GSDP) and a per capita net state domestic product of ₹222,000 (US$2,800).The tertiary sector contributes around 65% to state's GSVA, while the primary sector contributes only 8%.</i></p>

            <p><i>The culture of Kerala is composite and cosmopolitan in nature and it is an integral part of Indian culture. It is a synthesis of Aryan, Dravidian, Arab, and European cultures,developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad.It is defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali people.It was elaborated through centuries of contact with neighbouring and overseas cultures.However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions.Over 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state every year.The Malayalam calendar, a solar sidereal calendar started from 825 CE in Kerala,finds common usage in planning agricultural and religious activities.[578] Malayalam, one of the classical languages in India, is Kerala's official language.[579] Over a dozen other scheduled and unscheduled languages are also spoken.Kerala has the greatest consumption of alcohol in India.</i></p>

In comparison with the rest of India, Kerala experiences relatively little sectarianism.According to 2011 Census of India figures, 54.7% of Kerala's residents are Hindus, 26.6% are Muslims, 18.4% are Christians, and the remaining 0.3% follow another religion or have no religious affiliation.Hindus represent the biggest religious group in all districts except Malappuram, where they are outnumbered by Muslims.[495] Kerala has the largest population of Christians in India.As of 2016, Hindus, Muslims, Christians and others account for 41.9%, 42.6%, 1</i></p>

            <p><i>Elephants have been an integral part of the culture of the state. Almost all of the local festivals in Kerala include at least one richly caparisoned elephant. Kerala is home to the largest domesticated population of elephants in India—about 700 Indian elephants, owned by temples as well as individuals.These elephants are mainly employed for the processions and displays associated with festivals celebrated all around the state. More than 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state annually and some animal lovers have sometimes raised concerns regarding the overwork of domesticated elephants during them.In Malayalam literature, elephants are referred to as the "sons of the sahya".The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala.[</i></p>
        <p><i>Kerala is home to a number of performance arts. These include five classical dance forms: Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Koodiyattom, Thullal and Krishnanattam, which originated and developed in the temple theatres during the classical period under the patronage of royal houses.Kerala natanam, Thirayattam,Kaliyattam, Theyyam, Koothu and Padayani are other dance forms associated with the temple culture of the region.Some traditional dance forms such as Oppana and Duffmuttu were popular among the Muslims of the state,while Margamkali and Parichamuttukali are popular among the Syrian Christians and Chavittu nadakom is popular among the Latin Christians</i></p>
       <p><i>Almost all[citation needed] of the local festivals in Kerala include at least one richly caparisoned elephant. Elephants carry the deity during annual festival processions and ceremonial circumnambulations in the Hindu temples. The temple elephants are decorated with gold plated caparisons ("nettipattam"), bells, and necklaces. People mounted on the elephants hold tinselled silk parasols ("muttukuda") up high, swaying white tufts ("vencamaram") and peacock feather fans ("alavattam") to the rhythm of the orchestra.[4] Seventeen elephants are engaged for the daily ceremonial rounds to the accomplishment of Pancari Melam in Kudalmanikyam temple. The headgear of seven of these elephants is made of pure gold and rest of pure silver, which is unique to this temple.[citation needed] 15 elephants are caparisoned for the seevili at tripnithura poornathrayeesa temple vrishchikolsavam. This the biggest temple festival in the world. The elephant carrying lord poornathrayeesa will be decorated by swarna thalekkettu( nettippattam made of pure gold from the kings treseory).</i></p>
